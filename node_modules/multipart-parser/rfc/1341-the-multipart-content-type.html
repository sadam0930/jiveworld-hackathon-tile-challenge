</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><A
NAME="z3" HREF="0_TableOfContents.html">7.2</A>  The Multipart Content-Type</H1>In the case of multiple part messages,
in which one or  more  different
sets  of  data  are  combined in
a single body, a  "multipart" Content-Type
field must appear in  the  entity's
 header. The body must then contain
one or more "body parts,"  each
preceded by an encapsulation boundary,
and the last one  followed  by a
 closing boundary.  Each part starts
with an  encapsulation  boundary,
and  then  contains  a  body  part
 consisting  of   header area, a
blank line, and a body area.  Thus
a body part is similar to an RFC
822 message in syntax,  but different
in meaning. <P>
A body part is NOT to be interpreted
as  actually  being  an  RFC  822
message.   To  begin  with,  NO header
fields are  actually required in
body parts.  A body  part  that starts
 with  a blank line, therefore,
is allowed and is a body part  for
which all default values are to be
assumed.  In  such  a  case,  the
absence  of  a Content-Type header
field implies  that the encapsulation
is plain  US-ASCII  text.   <A
NAME="z2">The only
 header  fields  that have defined
meaning for body parts are  those
the names of which begin with "Content-".
  All  other  header fields  are
 generally  to be ignored in body
parts.</A>  Although  they should  generally
 be   retained  in   mail  processing,
 they may be discarded by gateways
if necessary.  Such other fields
are permitted to appear in body parts
 but  should not  be  depended on.
"X-" fields may be created for 
experimental or private purposes,
with the recognition that  the information
they contain may be lost at some
gateways. <P>
The distinction between an RFC 822
message and a  body  part  is  subtle,
but  important.  A gateway between
Internet and  X.400 mail, for example,
must be able to tell the difference
 between  a  body part that contains
an image and a body part  that contains
an encapsulated message, the body
of which  is  an  image.   In order
to represent the latter, the body
part  must have "Content-Type: message",
and its body  (after  the  blank
line)  must be the encapsulated message,
with its own  "Content-Type: image"
header  field.   The  use of  similar
 syntax facilitates the conversion
of messages to body parts,  and
vice versa, but the distinction between
the two must be  understood  by
implementors. (For the special case
in which  all parts actually are
messages, a "digest" subtype is 
also  defined.) <P>
As stated previously, each  body
part  is  preceded  by  an  encapsulation
boundary.  The encapsulation boundary
MUST NOT  appear inside any of the
encapsulated parts.   Thus,  it is
 crucial  that  the  composing agent
 be  able to choose and  specify
the unique boundary that will separate
the parts. <P>
All present and future subtypes of
the "multipart" type must  use an
 identical  syntax.  Subtypes may
 differ  in their  semantics, and
may impose additional restrictions
on syntax,  but  must  conform to
the required syntax for the multipart
 type.  This requirement ensures
that  all  conformant  user  agents
will  at least be able to recognize
and separate the  parts of any multipart
 entity,  even  of  an unrecognized
 subtype. <P>
As stated in the definition of the
Content-Transfer-Encoding  field,
no encoding other than "7bit", "8bit",
or "binary" is  permitted for entities
of type "multipart".   The  multipart
 delimiters  and  header fields
are always 7-bit ASCII in any  case,
and data within the body parts can
be  encoded  on  a  part-by-part
basis,  with  Content-Transfer-Encoding
fields  for each appropriate body
part. <P>
Mail gateways, relays, and other
mail  handling  agents  are  commonly
known  to alter the top-level header
of an RFC 822  message.   In particular,
they frequently  add,  remove,  or
 reorder  header  fields.   Such
alterations  are explicitly  forbidden
for the body part headers embedded
in  the  bodies  of messages of
type "multipart." 
<H2><A
NAME="z0">7.2.1     Multipart:  The common
syntax</A></H2>All subtypes of "multipart" share
a common  syntax,  defined  in this
 section.   A simple example of a
multipart message  also appears
in this section.  An example of a
more  complex  multipart message
is given in Appendix C. <P>
The Content-Type field for multipart
entities requires  one  parameter,
 "boundary",   which  is  used to
 specify  the  encapsulation boundary.
  The  encapsulation boundary   is
 defined   as  a line  consisting
 entirely  of  two hyphen  characters
("-", decimal code 45) followed by
 the  boundary  parameter value
from the Content-Type header field.
<P>
NOTE:  The hyphens are  for  rough
compatibility  with  the  earlier
RFC  934  method  of message encapsulation,
and for  ease   of   searching 
for   the   boundaries    in   some
 implementations.  However, it should
be noted that multipart  messages
 are  NOT  completely compatible
 with   RFC   934  encapsulations;
in  particular,  they  do  not obey
RFC 934  quoting conventions  for
embedded  lines  that  begin  with
 hyphens.   This  mechanism  was
chosen  over  the  RFC  934  mechanism
because the latter causes lines to
grow with  each  level  of  quoting.
The combination of this growth with
the  fact that SMTP implementations
sometimes  wrap  long  lines  made
the  RFC 934 mechanism unsuitable
for use in the event  that deeply-nested
multipart structuring is ever desired.
<P>
Thus, a typical multipart Content-Type
header  field  might  look like
this: 
<PRE>
     Content-Type: multipart/mixed; 
          boundary=gc0p4Jq0M2Yt08jU534c0p
 
</PRE>This indicates that the entity consists
of  several  parts,  each itself
with a structure that is syntactically
identical  to an RFC 822 message,
except that the header area might
be  completely  empty,  and  that
the parts are each preceded by 
the line 
<PRE>
     --gc0p4Jq0M2Yt08jU534c0p
 
</PRE>Note that the  encapsulation  boundary
must  occur  at  the  beginning
of  a line, i.e., following a CRLF,
and that that  initial CRLF is considered
to be part of  the  encapsulation
 boundary  rather  than  part  of
the preceding part.    The  boundary
must be followed immediately either
by another CRLF  and the header
fields for the next part, or by two
CRLFs, in  which case there are
no header fields for the next part
(and  it is therefore assumed to
be of Content-Type text/plain). <P>
NOTE:   The  CRLF  preceding  the
encapsulation   line   is  considered
part  of  the boundary so that it
is possible to  have a part that
does not end with  a  CRLF  (line
 break).  Body  parts that must
be considered to end with line breaks,
 therefore, should have two CRLFs
preceding the encapsulation  line,
the first of which is part of the
preceding body part,  and the  second
of  which  is  part  of  the  encapsulation
 boundary. <P>
The requirement that the encapsulation
boundary begins  with  a  CRLF implies
 that  the  body of a multipart entity
must  itself begin with a CRLF before
the first encapsulation line  --
 that  is, if the "preamble" area
is not used, the entity  headers
must be followed by TWO CRLFs.  This
is  indeed  how  such  entities
should be composed.  A tolerant mail
reading  program, however, may interpret
a  body  of  type multipart  that
 begins  with  an encapsulation line
NOT initiated by a  CRLF  as  also
 being  an encapsulation  boundary,
 but  a  compliant  mail  sending
 program must  not  generate  such
 entities. <P>
Encapsulation  boundaries  must not
  appear   within   the  encapsulations,
and  must  be no longer than 70 characters,
 not counting the two leading hyphens.
<P>
The encapsulation boundary following
the last body part is a  distinguished
delimiter that indicates that no
further body  parts will follow.
Such a delimiter  is  identical to
 the  previous  delimiters, with
the addition of two more hyphens
 at the end of the line: 
<PRE>
     --gc0p4Jq0M2Yt08jU534c0p-- 
</PRE>There appears to be room for additional
information prior to  the  first
encapsulation  boundary  and following
the final  boundary.  These areas
should generally be left  blank,
and  implementations  should  ignore
anything that appears before  the
first boundary or after the last
one. <P>
NOTE:  These "preamble" and "epilogue"
areas  are  not  used  because of
the lack of proper typing of these
parts and the  lack  of  clear semantics
 for  handling  these areas   at
 gateways, particularly X.400 gateways.
<P>
NOTE:  Because encapsulation boundaries
must not  appear  in  the  body
parts  being  encapsulated,  a user
 agent  must  exercise care to choose
a unique boundary.  The boundary
 in  the example above could have
been the result of an algorithm 
designed to produce boundaries with
a very  low  probability  of already
 existing in the data to be encapsulated
without  having to prescan  the
 data.   Alternate algorithms  might
 result in more 'readable' boundaries
for a recipient with an  old user
agent, but would require  more  attention
 to  the  possibility   that   the
  boundary  might  appear  in  the
 encapsulated part.   The  simplest
 boundary possible   is  something
like "---", with a closing boundary
of "-----". <P>
As a very simple example, the  following
multipart  message  has  two  parts,
both  of  them  plain  text,  one
of them  explicitly typed and one
of them implicitly typed: 
<PRE>
     From: Nathaniel Borenstein &lt;nsb@bellcore.com> 
     To:  Ned Freed &lt;ned@innosoft.com> 
     Subject: Sample message 
     MIME-Version: 1.0 
     Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary="simple 
     boundary" 

     This is the preamble.  It is to be ignored, though it 
     is a handy place for mail composers to include an 
     explanatory note to non-MIME compliant readers. 
     --simple boundary 

     This is implicitly typed plain ASCII text. 
     It does NOT end with a linebreak. 
     --simple boundary 
     Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii 

     This is explicitly typed plain ASCII text. 
     It DOES end with a linebreak. 

     --simple boundary-- 
     This is the epilogue.  It is also to be ignored.

</PRE>The use of a Content-Type of multipart
in a body part within  another multipart
 entity  is explicitly allowed. 
 In such  cases, for obvious reasons,
care must  be  taken  to ensure 
that  each  nested  multipart entity
 must  use a different  boundary
delimiter. See Appendix C for an
example of  nested  multipart entities.
<P>
The use of the multipart Content-Type
with  only  a  single  body  part
may  be  useful  in  certain  contexts,
and  is  explicitly permitted. <P>
The only mandatory parameter for
the multipart  Content-Type  is
the  boundary  parameter,  which
consists  of  1  to 70  characters
from a set of characters known to
be very  robust  through  email
gateways,  and  NOT ending with white
space.  (If a boundary appears to
end with white  space,  the  white
 space  must be presumed to have
been added by a gateway, and  should
be  deleted.)   It  is  formally
specified  by  the  following BNF:

<PRE>
boundary := 0*69&lt;bchars> bcharsnospace 

bchars := bcharsnospace / " " 

bcharsnospace :=    DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" / "+"  / 
"_" 
               / "," / "-" / "." / "/" / ":" / "=" / "?" 

</PRE>Overall, the body of a multipart
entity may be specified  as  follows:

<PRE>
multipart-body := preamble 1*encapsulation 
               close-delimiter epilogue 

encapsulation := delimiter CRLF body-part 

delimiter := CRLF "--" boundary   ; taken from  Content-Type 
field. 
                               ;   when   content-type    is 
multipart 
                             ; There must be no space 
                             ; between "--" and boundary. 

close-delimiter := delimiter "--" ; Again, no  space  before 
"--" 

preamble :=  *text                  ;  to  be  ignored  upon 
receipt. 

epilogue :=  *text                  ;  to  be  ignored  upon 
receipt. 

body-part = &lt;"message" as defined in RFC 822, 
         with all header fields optional, and with the 
         specified delimiter not occurring anywhere in 
         the message body, either on a line by itself 
         or as a substring anywhere.  Note that the 
         semantics of a part differ from the semantics 
         of a message, as described in the text.> 

</PRE>NOTE:  Conspicuously missing from
the multipart  type  is  a  notion
of  structured,  related body parts.
In general, it  seems premature
to try to  standardize  interpart
structure  yet.  It is recommended
that those wishing to provide a more
 structured or integrated multipart
messaging facility should  define
 a   subtype  of  multipart  that
is  syntactically  identical, but
that  always  expects  the  inclusion
of  a  distinguished part that can
be used to specify the structure
 and integration of the other parts,
probably  referring  to  them by
 their Content-ID field.  If this
approach is used,  other implementations
will not recognize  the  new  subtype,
 but  will  treat it as the primary
subtype (multipart/mixed)  and will
thus be able to show the user the
parts  that  are  recognized. 
<H2>7.2.2     The Multipart/mixed (primary)
subtype</H2>The primary subtype for multipart,
"mixed", is intended  for  use when
 the body parts are independent and
intended to be  displayed  serially.
 Any  multipart   subtypes   that
 an  implementation does not recognize
should be treated as being  of subtype
"mixed". 
<H2>7.2.3     The Multipart/alternative
subtype </H2>The multipart/alternative type is
syntactically identical to  multipart/mixed,
 but  the  semantics  are  different.
 In  particular, each of the parts
is an "alternative" version of 
the same information.  User agents
should recognize that the  content
of the various parts are interchangeable.
The  user  agent  should  either
choose  the  "best" type based on
the  user's environment and preferences,
or offer  the  user  the  available
alternatives.  In general, choosing
the best type  means displaying
only the LAST part that can  be displayed.
 This  may be used, for example,
to send mail in a fancy text  format
in such  a  way  that it  can  easily
 be  displayed  anywhere: 
<PRE>
From:  Nathaniel Borenstein &lt;nsb@bellcore.com> 
To: Ned Freed &lt;ned@innosoft.com> 
Subject: Formatted text mail 
MIME-Version: 1.0 
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=boundary42 


--boundary42 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii 

...plain text version of message goes here.... 

--boundary42 
Content-Type: text/richtext 

.... richtext version of same message goes here ... 
--boundary42 
Content-Type: text/x-whatever 

.... fanciest formatted version of same  message  goes  here 
... 
--boundary42-- 

</PRE>In this example, users  whose  mail
system  understood  the  "text/x-whatever"
format  would see only the fancy
version,  while other users would
see only the richtext or plain  text
 version, depending on the capabilities
of their system. <P>
In general, user agents that  compose
multipart/alternative  entities
should place the body parts in increasing
order of  preference, that is, with
the  preferred  format  last.  For
 fancy  text,  the sending user
agent should put the plainest  format
first and the richest format  last.
 Receiving  user  agents  should
pick  and  display  the last format
they are  capable of  displaying.
 In  the  case  where  one  of the
 alternatives  is  itself  of type
 "multipart" and contains  unrecognized
sub-parts, the user agent may choose
either  to  show that alternative,
an earlier alternative, or both.
<P>
NOTE:  From an implementor's perspective,
it might seem more  sensible  to
reverse  this  ordering, and have
the plainest  alternative last.
However, placing the plainest alternative
 first    is    the    friendliest
 possible   option   when  mutlipart/alternative
entities are viewed using a  non-MIME-
 compliant mail reader.  While this
approach does impose some  burden
on  compliant  mail  readers,  interoperability
with  older  mail  readers was deemed
to be more important in this  case.
<P>
It may be the case  that  some  user
agents,  if  they  can  recognize
more than one of the formats, will
prefer to offer  the user the choice
of which format  to  view.   This
makes  sense, for example, if mail
includes both a nicely-formatted
 image version and an easily-edited
text  version.   What  is  most
critical,  however, is that the user
not automatically  be shown multiple
versions of the  same  data.  Either
 the  user  should  be shown the
last recognized version or should
 explicitly be given the choice.

<H2>7.2.4     The Multipart/digest subtype
</H2>This document defines a "digest"
subtype  of  the  multipart  Content-Type.
 This  type  is  syntactically identical
 to  multipart/mixed, but  the 
semantics  are  different.   In 
particular,  in a digest, the default
Content-Type value for  a   body
  part   is   changed   from    "text/plain"
   to  "message/rfc822".  This 
is  done  to allow a more readable
 digest format that is largely 
compatible  (except  for the  quoting
convention) with RFC 934. <P>
A digest in this format might,  then,
look  something  like  this: 
<PRE>
From: Moderator-Address 
MIME-Version: 1.0 
Subject:  Internet Digest, volume 42 
Content-Type: multipart/digest; 
     boundary="---- next message ----" 


------ next message ---- 

From: someone-else 
Subject: my opinion 

...body goes here ... 

------ next message ---- 

From: someone-else-again 
Subject: my different opinion 

... another body goes here... 

------ next message ------


</PRE>
<H2><A
NAME="z1">7.2.5     The Multipart/parallel
subtype</A></H2>This document defines a "parallel"
subtype of the  multipart  Content-Type.
 This  type  is  syntactically identical
 to  multipart/mixed, but  the 
semantics  are  different.   In 
particular,  in  a  parallel entity,
 all  of the parts are  intended
to be presented in parallel, i.e.,
 simultaneously,  on  hardware and
 software  that  are  capable of
doing so.  Composing agents should
be aware that many mail readers will
 lack this capability and will show
the parts serially in any  event.
